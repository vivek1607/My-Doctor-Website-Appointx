#1.0 Introduction: 
In our runaway life, health is one of the most important things for us. Health is the pivot upon which a man’s whole personality and well-being depend. An ailing and aching body saps the enthusiasm for pursuit. But the everyday works keep us busy a lot and therefore, we lack in maintaining good health. Thus we visit doctors often for health checkups, but the biggest problem that we face is the availability of time. Different work personal have different available times, this makes it difficult for them to visit doctors according to their free time and doctor's availability. 
Thus, keeping this as the basis of our project. We are developing a web application that will make it easy for the patients to have appointments with the doctor after seeing the time of availability of the doctor. The main aim of our project is to provide the time in which a patient can have an appointment with the doctor based on the availability of the respective doctor. Thus the patient can book for an appointment suitably. This project also provides a record of previous appointments of the patient and a record of previous patients of the doctor.

#1.1 Objective
This project plan has the following objectives:
Information on the availability of the doctor(s).
Hassle-free appointment booking.
Easy appointment cancellation.
Record of the patient’s previous appointments.
Record of previous patients of the doctor.
Registration details of the Doctor for the patient’s trust.

#1.2 Scope
This software system will be a web application for patients and medical practitioners, as a patient need to go to the doctor and the doctor needs patients. More specifically, a simple and intuitive system whereby the patient can get a check-up from the doctor according to his time. According to this system, a patient can book or can cancel an appointment and can keep a record of previous visits. And the doctor can give his availability in the week and can have a record of old and new appointments.
